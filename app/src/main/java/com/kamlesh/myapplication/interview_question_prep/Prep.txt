////////////////////////////////////High Order function///////////////////

fun myHighOrderFunction(x, y, operation(x, y)-> Unit) {

return operation(x,y)
}

val multiplication = myHighOrderFunction(2,3){x,y -> x*y}
val additaion = myHighOrderFunction(2,3){x,y -> x+y)

print(multiplication)
print(additaion)

If we see for collection framework/////////////////

var list = listOf("apple", "chese", "Banana")

val sortedList = list.sortBy {it.lenght}

print(sortedList)


Callbacks in Asynchronous Operations////////////////


fun loadData(onSuccess: (String) -> Unit, onFailure (Exception) -> Unit) {

try {

onSuccess("Data Loaded SuccessFully")

} chach(e Exception) {

onFailure(e.message)
}
}

loadData(
    onSuccess = { data -> println(data) },
    onFailure = { error -> println("Error: $error") }
)

High-order functions enable function chaining where the output of one function becomes the input for another.//////////////

fun multiplyByTwo(x: Int): Int = x * 2
fun addThree(x: Int): Int = x + 3

val result = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4).map(::multiplyByTwo).map(::addThree)
println(result) // Output: [5, 7, 9, 11]



///////////////////Lamda function//////////////////////////


Defination:


A lambda expression is an anonymous function that can be passed around as a value. It's a concise way to define a function inline without giving it a name.

Key Characteristics:
Anonymous function: A lambda doesn't have a name and is defined inline.
Concise syntax: Lambdas often reduce boilerplate code.
Used as arguments: Lambdas are frequently passed to high-order functions as parameters.





Differences and usecase


Definition	
A lambda is an anonymous function that can be used as a value.
A high-order function is a function that takes another function (lambda) as a parameter or returns a function.
	
	
Role	
Lambda represents a block of code (a function) that can be passed around and executed later.	
High-order functions define higher-level behavior by accepting or returning other functions (lambdas).

Usage	

Lambdas are typically used as function arguments, passed to high-order functions.	
High-order functions provide a mechanism to pass lambdas or other functions, allowing flexible operations.


Example	

{ x: Int, y: Int -> x + y } (Lambda expression that adds two numbers)	
fun doOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int) (High-order function that accepts a lambda)


Purpose

	Used to provide inline, anonymous functionality without defining named functions.	
	Used to provide flexibility and generality by accepting various behaviors (functions) as arguments or return values.
	
Relation

	Lambdas are often passed as arguments to high-order functions.	
	High-order functions frequently accept lambdas or return them as part of their operation.
	
	
Return 
Type	Lambdas don’t need explicit return types but infer them based on context.	
High-order functions must specify if they return another function or accept one as a parameter.



///////////////////////////////INline function///////////////////////////////////////////////////


INline function is when we use inline keyword in function and whenever the compiler fins an inline fun it directly call function body insted od creating method object creating and it is
manly used in highorder function where we pass lemdas as parameter.When we call non inline function its object is getting created and classes behind the screen and mak lag in performance.

inline fun performOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
    return operation(a, b)
}

val result = performOperation(5, 10) { x, y -> x + y }
println(result) 


Use Case of Inline Functions
Performance-Intensive Operations If you have a high-order function that's called frequently or with lambdas, making it inline can improve performance.

Avoiding Memory Allocations for Lambdas Inline functions can prevent memory allocation for lambda objects and their capturing environments.


///////////////////////////////////CrossLine function///////////////////////////////

Crossinline Functions
The crossinline keyword is used in combination with inline to prevent the lambda from being non-local. In Kotlin,
 lambdas can normally use non-local returns (i.e., return from the enclosing function). However, 
 if you want to ensure that the lambda passed to an inline function cannot return from the calling function, you mark it as crossinline.

Why Use Crossinline?
Prevent Non-local Returns: In certain cases,
 you may want to prevent a lambda from returning from the outer function. 
 
 
 This is useful when you're doing operations inside loops, asynchronous tasks, or callbacks where non-local returns are undesirable.
 
 Use Case of Crossinline
Asynchronous Operations If you're executing code asynchronously in a different thread, you generally don't want non-local returns.
 In such cases, you can use crossinline to prevent returning from the outer function.

Loop and Callback Scenarios In loops or callbacks, using crossinline can help you avoid accidental returns that could break the flow of execution.








//////////////////////////////////NonLine fun////////////////////


Noinline Functions
In inline functions, noinline is the keyword used to exclude certain lambda parameters from being inlined.
 If a function has multiple lambda parameters but you want only some of them to be inlined (while keeping others as actual objects),
 you can use noinline on the lambdas you don't want to be inlined.

Why Use Noinline?
Keep Certain Lambda Objects: If you want the flexibility of creating objects for certain lambdas (perhaps for later invocation or passing to other functions),
 you can mark them as noinline.
Mixed Use: Some lambdas may benefit from inlining, while others may not.



When to Use Inline, Crossinline, and Noinline
Use Inline:

For performance improvement, especially in high-order functions that take lambdas as arguments.
When you want to eliminate the overhead of function calls and object creation for lambdas.


Use Crossinline:

When you want to prevent non-local returns in lambdas (e.g., in asynchronous or callback scenarios).
For lambdas that shouldn't break the flow of the outer function.


Use Noinline:

When you want some lambda arguments to remain as objects for deferred execution or further processing.
When the lambda passed will be stored, passed to another function, or executed multiple times outside the scope of the original call.
