// Reflection

// Reflection is a feature in Kotlin that allows us to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and other elements of the code at runtime.
// It is a powerful tool that can be used to create dynamic applications, such as frameworks, libraries, and plugins.

// In Kotlin, reflection is provided by the kotlin-reflect library, which is part of the Kotlin standard library.

// The kotlin-reflect library provides a set of classes and functions that allow us to work with reflection in Kotlin.

// How to use reflection in Kotlin

// To use reflection in Kotlin, you need to import the kotlin-reflect library in your project.

// You can import the kotlin-reflect library by adding the following dependency to your build.gradle file:

// dependencies {
//     implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-reflect:$kotlin_version"
// }

// Once you have imported the kotlin-reflect library, you can use reflection in your Kotlin code.

// For example, you can use reflection to inspect the properties of a class, call methods dynamically, and create new instances of classes.

// Here is an example of how to use reflection to inspect the properties of a class:

// fun main() {

//     val user = User("John", 30)

//     val kClass = user::class

//     kClass.memberProperties.forEach { prop ->
//         println("${prop.name} = ${prop.get(user)}")
//     }
// }

// data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)

// In this code, we create an instance of the User class and use reflection to inspect its properties.

// We get the KClass object for the User class by using the ::class syntax.

// We then use the memberProperties property of the KClass object to get a list of all the properties of the class.

// We iterate over the list of properties and print the name and value of each property.

// This is just one example of how you can use reflection in Kotlin. There are many other ways to use reflection to create dynamic applications.
